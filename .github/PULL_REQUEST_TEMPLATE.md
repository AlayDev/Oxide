Hello there,

Thank you for the interest in contributing! Before you open this Pull Request, please review the following steps and guide:

### Step 1: Describe the changes

- **Describe the purpose of your changes.** What the change does, why you'd like to to be accepted, etc. This will help us understand any risks or potential issues with merging the changes.

- **Describe any known issues or limitations with your changes.** For example, if the changes do not apply to a supported game please mention it as well as any other sort of compatibility issues.

### Step 2: Review the checklist

Please use the checklist that is most closely related to your Pull Request _(you only need to use one checklist, and you can skip items that aren't applicable or don't make sense)_:

- [ ] If this is a major change with potentially breaking changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/oxidemod/oxide/issues) first to discuss if you haven't already.
- [ ] Ensure that the changes compile and match the formatting conventions and standards used
- [ ] Update or add passing unit tests to cover the changes introduced
- [ ] Update or add any necessary API documentation

### Step 3: Documentation

If your change involves a hook or API, please make sure to update or add the related [documentation](https://github.com/oxidemod/docs) as well.

-----

That's it! After reviewing the guidelines above you can delete this text from the Pull Request. We will try to test and merge the change as soon as we can if there are not noticable issues, but keep in mind that may not immediately respond to every request.

Thanks again for contributing!
